## üîÑ Flow Steps Breakdown

1. **Trigger on Form Submission**
   Uses Microsoft Forms to collect onboarding information (e.g., name, department, job role, manager).
   The flow is triggered when a response is submitted.

2. **Initialize Core User Details**
   Generate secure password for the new user.
   Set nickname and prepare group logic using variables and expressions.

3. **Get Group Membership Logic**
   Dynamically checks existing Microsoft 365 / Entra ID groups to:
   Distinguish distribution groups vs. security groups.
   Avoid dynamic groups (read-only).
   Filter and map applicable groups for the user.

4. **Create the User in Entra ID**
   Creates the user with key attributes including:
   Display Name, UPN, Department, Job Title.
   Initial password setup.

5. **Assign Organizational Attributes**
   Assigns:Manager (from Form)
   Licenses (via Graph API or built-in connector)
   Groups based on role/business unit

6. **Send Notifications**
   Sends an email to the manager/HR notifying that the user has been created successfully and is being provisioned.

7. **Add to Business Applications**
   Uses a Loop + Switch block to configure the user in appropriate business systems (e.g., Ninja, ERP, CRM).
   Optional: Generates a helpdesk ticket for manual configuration steps.

8. **Send Welcome Email to the Employee**

Final step: Sends a customized welcome email to the new user with relevant links, credentials, or onboarding documents and instructions on how to set up Microsoft authenticator.
